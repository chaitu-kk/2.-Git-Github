# Top 10 Git Branch & Tag Interview Questions (with Simple Answers)

---

### 1. **What is a branch in Git?**

👉 A branch is like a **separate line of development**. It allows you to work on features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the `main` (or `master`) branch.

---

### 2. **Why do we use branches?**

👉 We use branches to:

* Work on new features safely.
* Keep production code stable.
* Allow multiple developers to work in parallel.

---

### 3. **How do you create a new branch?**

👉 Command:

```bash
git branch feature-login
```

This only **creates** the branch.

To create and switch at the same time:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-login
```

---

### 4. **How do you switch between branches?**

👉 Command:

```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

or (new way):

```bash
git switch branch-name
```

---

### 5. **How do you merge one branch into another?**

👉 First, switch to the branch where you want changes:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-login
```

This merges `feature-login` into `main`.

---

### 6. **What is the difference between a branch and a tag?**

* **Branch** → Moves forward with new commits (dynamic).
* **Tag** → Points to a specific commit, usually used for **releases** (static).

---

### 7. **How do you create a tag in Git?**

👉 Two types of tags:

* **Lightweight tag (just a name):**

  ```bash
  git tag v1.0
  ```

* **Annotated tag (with message, recommended):**

  ```bash
  git tag -a v1.0 -m "First release"
  ```

---

### 8. **How do you see all tags and branches?**

👉 Commands:

* For branches:

  ```bash
  git branch
  ```
* For tags:

  ```bash
  git tag
  ```

---

### 9. **How do you push a branch or tag to GitHub?**

👉 Push a branch:

```bash
git push origin branch-name
```

👉 Push a tag:

```bash
git push origin v1.0
```

👉 Push all tags at once:

```bash
git push origin --tags
```

---

### 10. **How do you delete a branch or tag?**

👉 Delete a local branch:

```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```

👉 Delete a remote branch:

```bash
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

👉 Delete a tag (local):

```bash
git tag -d v1.0
```

👉 Delete a tag (remote):

```bash
git push origin --delete tag v1.0
```
===========================================================
Got it 👍
You need **real-time project-based content** so you can **explain to the interview panelist** how you used **stash, branch, and tag** in your day-to-day work.

Here’s a **clear explanation in simple English** that you can use as your **own story in interviews**:

# Real-Time Usage of Git Stash, Branch, and Tag in Projects

---

### **1. Real-Time Usage of Git Branch**

👉 In my projects, we always follow a **branching strategy** (like Git Flow).

* **`main` (or `master`) branch** → Stable code, used for production deployment.
* **`develop` branch** → Integration branch where all developers merge their work.
* **Feature branches** → Each new feature is developed in a separate branch, e.g., `feature-login`, `feature-payment`.
* **Release branch** → Before deployment, we create a release branch for testing, e.g., `release-v1.0`.
* **Hotfix branch** → If an urgent production issue comes, we create `hotfix-branch` directly from `main`.

👉 **Example I explained in interviews:**

> I was working on a `feature-payment` branch. Once my work was tested, I created a pull request and merged it into `develop`. This way, production (`main`) was never affected until we finalized everything.

---

### **2. Real-Time Usage of Git Tag**

👉 We use **tags for releases**. Tags help us identify a specific version of the code.

* Example: After testing is completed on `release-v1.0` branch, we merge it into `main` and then create a tag:

  ```bash
  git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"
  git push origin v1.0
  ```
* This helps the deployment team pick exactly `v1.0` for production release.
* If any issue happens in production, we know exactly which commit/tag was deployed.

👉 **Example I explained in interviews:**

> When we deployed version 2.3 of our application, I created an annotated tag `v2.3`. Later, when a bug was reported in production, we quickly checked out the `v2.3` tag to reproduce the exact issue and provide a hotfix.

---

### **3. Real-Time Usage of Git Stash**

👉 Stash is very useful when we are in the middle of development but need to switch quickly.

* Example: I was working on a `feature-login` branch and got an urgent production bug request. My code was half-done, not ready for commit.
* I used:

  ```bash
  git stash save "WIP - login screen"
  git checkout hotfix-issue-123
  ```
* After fixing the issue and merging it, I came back to my feature branch and restored my work:

  ```bash
  git stash pop
  ```

👉 **Example I explained in interviews:**

> This showed my ability to handle **multi-tasking in real time** without losing half-done work.

---

### **Summary to Tell Panelist**

* **Branch**: I use feature branches for development, release branches for deployment testing, and hotfix branches for urgent production fixes.
* **Tag**: I use annotated tags for marking production releases (v1.0, v2.0, etc.), which helps in rollback and tracking.
* **Stash**: I use stash when I need to switch tasks quickly without committing incomplete code.

⚡ This explanation sounds **practical and professional** — exactly what panelists look for.

Do you want me to **draft this in a Word file with neat formatting** (so you can take it as an interview prep document), or do you prefer a **short script** that you can directly **speak in front of panelists**?
